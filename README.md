### Using the app
Once you have set-up the app you are ready to use it.
- Run the server on your terminal with the command `rails server` by default the port is gonna be 3000 but if that port is not available you can run the server on a different port using `rails server -p 4001` where 4001 represents the port you choose.
- After the server is up and running open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`( if you changed the port number also changed it on the url.)
### Testing the app with RSpec
You can run just by typing `rspec` in your console, take into consideration that the pre-loaded tests were created by a Microverse student, feel free to write your own tests.
